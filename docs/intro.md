## Course Rationale

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, public services are increasingly leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance efficiency, accessibility, and citizen engagement. This comprehensive 3-day training program is designed to equip public servants with the knowledge and skills necessary to design, build, and deploy AI agents ethically and responsibly. The program focuses on practical, hands-on experience with Google's Agent Development Kit and Gemini large language model, emphasizing prompt engineering over traditional coding to empower a wider range of participants.

## Course Description

This 3-day training program offers a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of developing responsible AI agents for public services. Participants will learn how to design and build AI agents using Google's Agent Development Kit and Gemini, with a strong focus on ethical considerations, fairness, accountability, and transparency. Through a blend of lectures, interactive discussions, and hands-on workshops, participants will gain practical experience in prompt engineering, agent design, and ethical AI frameworks.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this training program, participants will be able to: Understand the core principles of responsible AI and their application in public services. Master the fundamentals of prompt engineering to effectively interact with and guide large language models like Gemini. Utilize Google AI Studio and Gemini CLI for agent development. Design and build a simple AI agent using Google's Agent Development Kit. Integrate tools and Artifacts to enhance agent capabilities. Apply an ethical framework to the design and deployment of AI agents in a public service context.
