# Course Overview

**Time:** 9:00 am - 9:30 am

## Course Objectives

By the end of this module, participants will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of AI, LLMs, and Generative AI
- Set up the development environment for working with AI models
- Execute basic AI model interactions

## Introduction to AI, LLMs, and Generative AI

### What is Artificial Intelligence?
AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. It encompasses various subfields including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

### Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs are a type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. Examples include:
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

### Generative AI in Action
Generative AI can create new content, including:
- Text generation
- Code generation
- Image creation
- Audio synthesis

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git
- Node.js (for some development environments)

### Installing Required Packages

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv ai-env
source ai-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `ai-env\Scripts\activate`

# Install essential libraries
pip install openai transformers torch
```

## Hands-on Examples

### Example 1: Basic Text Generation with Transformers

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained text generation model
generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='gpt2')

# Generate text
prompt = "Artificial Intelligence is"
generated_text = generator(prompt, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)
print(generated_text[0]['generated_text'])
```

### Example 2: Sentiment Analysis

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained sentiment analysis model
classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

# Analyze sentiment
result = classifier("I'm excited to learn about AI!")
print(f"Sentiment: {result[0]['label']}, Confidence: {result[0]['score']:.2f}")
```

### Example 3: Text Summarization

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a summarization model
summarizer = pipeline('summarization', model='facebook/bart-large-cnn')

# Summarize text
article = """
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to 
intelligence of humans or other animals. Example tasks in which this is done include 
speech recognition, computer vision, translation between languages, as well as other 
mappings of inputs.
"""
summary = summarizer(article, max_length=130, min_length=30, do_sample=False)
print(summary[0]['summary_text'])
```

## Exercises / Assessments

### Interactive Activity 1: Your First AI Interaction
1. Install the required packages
2. Run the text generation example
3. Modify the prompt and observe different outputs
4. Share your most interesting result with the group

### Interactive Activity 2: Sentiment Analysis
1. Test the sentiment analysis model with different sentences
2. Try to find edge cases where the model might be incorrect
3. Discuss the limitations of AI in understanding human emotions

## Next Steps
- Explore more advanced models and techniques
- Learn about fine-tuning models on custom datasets
- Understand the ethical implications of AI deployment

## Q&A Session
Time will be allocated for participants to ask questions and discuss any topics covered in this module.
